# Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# Casual
# Create a method
# request first number from the user and assign to a variable
# request second number from the user and assign to a variable
# add the two variables together
# print the result

# Formal

# Start

# method sum
# PRINT a request to user for the first number
# SET num1 = GET
# PRINT a request to user for the second number
# SET num2 = GET
# SET total = num1 + num2
# PRINT total

#END

# Casual
# Given an array of strings
# Itterate through the array one by one
# Take the first index and assign it to a variable
# Take each additionl index and add it to the array
# Print the variable

#Formal

#START

#GIVEN an array of strings called str

# SET i to 0
# WHILE i < str.length
  # SET
