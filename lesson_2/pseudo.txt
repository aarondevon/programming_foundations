 Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

 Casual 1.

 Create a method that takes in two parameters
 assign the first parameter to a variable
 assign the second parameter to a variable
 add the two variables together
 print the result

Formal 1.

Start

 method sum
 PRINT a request to user for the first number
 SET num1 = GET
 PRINT a request to user for the second number
 SET num2 = GET
 SET total = num1 + num2
 PRINT total

END

Casual 2.

 Given an array of strings
 Create a  method that takes in an array of strings
 Itterate through the array one by one
 Take the first index and assign it to a variable
 Take each additionl index and add it to the array
 Print the variable

Formal 2.

START

  GIVEN an array of strings called str

   SET i to 0
  method concat(arr)
   WHILE i < arr.length
    IF i == 0
      SET big_str = arr[0]
    ELSE
    big_str = big_str + " " + arr[i]

     i += i

  PRINT big str

END

Casual 3.
  Given an array of inegers
  Creat a method that takes in an array of integers as
